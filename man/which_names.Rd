\title{Find indices of TRUE entries in an array}
\usage{
which_names(.a, dimnames = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.a}{array}

\item{dimnames}{list of character vectors.
E.g., if `.a` is a matrix, then `length(dimnames) == 2`,
`dimnames[[1]]` is a vector of row names, and
`dimnames[[2]]` is a vector of column names.}

\item{...}{Additional options passed to [base::which()].}
}
\value{
a tibble of named indices
}
\description{
[base::which()] returns numeric indices of TRUE entries in an array.
This wrapper uses `dimnames` to return pairs of row/column names.
}
\examples{
which_names(mtcars[1:6, c("vs", "am")] == 1)
}
